Internet-of-Things Grandfather Clock / Church Bell / Booya Bell

There's a clock in every dang thang!  But, the old timey ways are good, too.  Build this simple IoT project and never ask the time again.

Requires: a filament printer or betta', a WeMos D1 mini, a small hobby servo, and some know-how.  Follow along.  You can do it if you try!

Not just a nerdy project - this thing is pretty nice to have.  You could even give it as a gift.
